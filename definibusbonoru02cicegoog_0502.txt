BOOK V. xxii

so unlike a human being as to feel no repulsion at
baseness and no approval for goodness? Who is ¹
there that does not hate a youth spent in debauchery
and wantonness? Who on the contrary would not
esteem modesty and orderliness in the young, even
though he has no personal concern in them?
Who does not hate the traitor Pullus Numitorius of
Fregellae, although he did a service to our country?
Who does not praise and extol Codrus, the preserver
of this city, or honour the daughters of Erechtheus?
or· loathe the very name of Tubulus? or love the
memory of Aristides? Do we forget the strong
emotion that we feel when we hear or read of some

53 deed of piety, of friendship or of magnanimity? But
Ι need not speak of ourselveS, whose birth, breeding
and education point us towards glory and towards
honour; think of the uneducated multitude-what
a tempest of applause rings through the theatre at
the words:

Iam Orestes, Ἴ

and at the rejoinder:
No, no, ’tis I, I say, Ι am Orestes,

And then when each offers a solution to the king in
his confusion and perplexity:

Then prithee slay us both3 we’ll die together:

as often as this scenea is acted, does it ever fail to
arouse the greatest enthusiasm? This proves that all
men without exception approve and applaud the dis-
position that not only seeks no advantage for itself,
but is loyal and true evento its own disadvantage.
ll These high examples crowd the pages not only of
romanoe but also of history, and especially the history
