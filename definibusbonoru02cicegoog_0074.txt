pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it

is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur ’
in which toil and pain can procure him some great
pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever

blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain
and trouble that are bound to ensue3 and equal blame
belongs to those who fail in their duty through
weakness of will, which is the same as saying through
shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are per·
fectly simple and easy to dist'urguish. In a free hour,
when our power of choice is untrammelled and when
nothing prevents our being able to do what we like
best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every
pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and
owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of
business it will frequently occur that pleasures have
to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise
man therefore always holds in these matters to this
principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure
other greater pleasures or else he endures pains t
