BOOK V. xxix

no one doubted that all hope alike of right conduct
and of happiness lay 1n virtue. Zeno having learnt
this doctrine from our school proceeded to deal with

of Metellus was happier than that of Regulus, yet

worthy of adoption’; and given the choice, that of
Metellus rs to be selected’ and that of Regulus

and in private life, but you leave off doing so in the ί
lecture-room. What then? do you think philo·

recognized form of expression; but so long as the
actual things remain, let them coin new words at

their pleasure.
