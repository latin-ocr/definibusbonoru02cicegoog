this process result the whole of the things that exist
and that we sce. Moreover‚ this movement ο1 the

atoms must not be conceived as starting from 3 be·
ginning, but as having gone on from 311 eternity.
18 Epicurus for his part, where he follows Democritus,
makes no serious blunders. Still, there rs 3 great
deal 1n each of them with which l do not agree, and
especially this: in the study ο1 Nature there are two x
questions to be asked, first, what 1s the matter out
of which each thing rs made second, what 1s the force
by which itis made3 now Democritus and Epicurus
have discussed the question ο1 matter, but they have
not considered the question ο1 force or the efficient
cause. But this is a desect shared by both3 Inow
cometothelapsespeculiartoEpicurus. He believes
that these same indivisible solid bodies are borne by
their own weight perpendicularly downward‚ which
l9 he holds is the natural motion os 311 bodies; but then
in the very same breath, being sharp enough to
recollect that if they 311 travelled downwards in
3 straight line, and, as'l said, perpendicularly, no one
stom would ever be able to overtike any other atom,
he consequently introduced an idea ο1 his own inven-
tion: he said that the atorn makes 3 very tiny swerve,
-the smcllest divergence possible3 and so are pro-
