BOOK Ι. iii-iv

10 Mucius’s sarcasm was however deserved. But for
my part Ι can never cease wondering what can be
the origin of the exaggerated contempt for home pro-
’ ducts that is now sashionable. lt would of course
be out os place to attempt to prove it here, but in my
opinion, as Ι have often argued, the Latin language,
so far from having a poor vocabulary, as is commonly
supposed, is actually richer than the Greek. When
have we, that is to say when have our competent
orators or poets‚ at all events since they have had
models to copy, ever lacked any of the resources
either of the florid or the chaste style? -- -· d

my duty, amidst the arduous labours and perils of a ἅμῑῖξᾯω
public career, at the post to which the Roman people ’ΝΜ ³¹¹·

also to use my best endeavours, with such zeal,
enthusiasm and energy as Ι possess, to promote the
advancement os learning among my fellow-country-

with people who prefer to read Greek, provided that
they actually do read it and do not merely pretend
to do so. lt is my business to serve those who

their own language are available, do not feel any

rather have me write on other subjects may fairly
be indulgent to one who has written much already
—in fact no one of our nation more—and who per-
haps will write still more if his life be prolonged.
And even were it not so, anyone who has made a
practice of studying my philosophical writings will
pronounce that none of them are better worth read· mmm&
