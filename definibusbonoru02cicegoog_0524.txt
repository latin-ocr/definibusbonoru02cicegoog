BOOK V. xxvin

The conclusions agree with the first principles, the
middle steps with both, in fact every part with every
other. They understand what inference follows from
and what contradicts a given premise. Itis like
geometry: grant· the premises and you must grant
everything. Admit that there is no good but Moral
Worth, and you are bound to admit that happiness
consists in virtue. Or again conversely: given the
³4 latter, you must grant the former. Your school are
not so logical. Three classes of goods’: your ex-
position runs smoothly on. lt comes to its conclu-

of happiness. That is the moral style, the style
of Socrates, and of Plato too. ‘1 dare assert it,’
cries the Academic. You cannot, unless you recast
the earlier part of the argument. lf poverty is an
evil, no beggar can be happy, be he as wisc as you
like. But Zeno dared to say that a wise beggar was
not only happy but also wealthy. Pain is an evil:
then a man sentenced to crucifixion cannot bc
happy. Children are a good: then childlessness is
miserable; one’s country is a good: then exile is
miserable ;health isagoodtthen the sick man is mise-

is miserable; good eyesight is a good: then blind-
ness is miserable. Perhaps the philosopher’s conso·
latiens can alleviate each of these missortunes singly;
but how will he enable us to endure them all at
once? Suppose a man to be at once blind, infirm,
afflicted by dire disease, in exile, childless, destitute
and tortured on the rack; what is your name, Zeno,
for him? ‘A happy man,’ says Zeno. Α supremely

happy man as well? ‘To be sure,' he wilsslsJeply,
