imagine them released from all anxiety, needing none
of the necessary equipment or accessories of life, and
with nothing else to do but to spend their whole time
uponstudyandresearchinthescienceofnature. We on
the other hand see in such studies not only the amuse-
ment of alife of happiness, but also the alleviation of
misfortune;hence the numbers of men whowhenthey
, had fallen into the power of enemies or tyrants, or
when theywere in prison or in exile,have solaced their
54 sorrow with the pursuit of learning. Demetrius of
Phalerum, the ruler of this city, when unjustly
banished from his country, repaired to the court of
King Ptolemy at Alexandria. Being eminent in thc
very system of philosophy which we are recommend-
ing to you, and a pupil of Theophrastus, he employed
the leisure ufforded by his disaster in composing a
number of excellent treatises, not for any practical
use in his own case, for from this he was debarred;
but he found a sort of food for his intellectual tastes
in thus cultivating his mind. l myself frequently
heard the blind err-praetor and scholar Gnaeus Aufi-
dius declare that he felt the actual loss of light more
than the inconvenience of blindness. Take lastly the
gift of sleep: did it not bring us repose for our bodies
and an antidote to labour, we should think it a viola-
tion of nature, for it robs us of sensation and entirely
suspends our activity3 so that if our nature did not
require repose or could obtain it in some other man-
ner, we should be quite content, inasmuch as even
as it is we frequently deny ourselves slumber, almost

to the point of doing violence to nature, in the in-
terests of business or of study.
