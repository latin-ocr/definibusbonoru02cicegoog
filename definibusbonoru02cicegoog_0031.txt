INTRODUGTION

sion' was impossible, but yet there was a ‘clearness’
about some impressions that gives a conviction oi
theirtruth.

, The next head, Antiochus, went beyond this
ambiguous position, and abandoned scepticism alto-
gether. Contradicting Philo, he maintained that
the true tradition of Plato had been lost, and pro·
fessed to recover it, calling his school the‘ Old

⁴ Academy' But his reading of the history of philo·

sophy was hardly more accurate than Philo s. He
asserted that the teachings of the older Academics
and Peripatetics and of the Stoics were, in Ethics
at all eventa, substantially the same, and that Zeno
had borrowed his tenets from his predecessors,
merely concealing the theft by his novel termin-
ology.

The latter thesis rs argued ιιι dc F turbas Book IV,
while Book V gives Antiochus’s version of the‘ Old
Academic and Peripatetic’ Ethics, which he himself
professed His doctrine rs that Virtue' rs sufficient
for happiness, but that ιιι the highest degree of
happiness bodily and external goods also form a part
The Stoics will not call these latter‘ goods} but
only‘ things promoted’; yet really they attach no
less importance to thern.

Antiochus could only maintain his position by
ignoring nice distinctions. The Ethics of Αιίε-1
totle in particular seem to have fallen into complete
oblivion. Aristotle’s cardinal doctrines are, that
well-being consists not in the state of virtue but in
the active exercise of all human excellenceS, and
particularly of man's highest gift of rational con-
templation3 and that though for this a modicum of
externa] goods is needed, these 'are but indispensable
