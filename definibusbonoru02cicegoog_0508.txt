such as to form part of the End and Ultimate Good.

68 Hence it results that we find two classes of things
desirable for their own sakes; one class consists of

set, which are external goods, that is, goods, that
belong neither to the mind nor to the body, such as
friends, parents, children, relatives and one’s country
itself, while intrinsically precious to us, yet are not
included in the same class as the former. Indeed,
no one could ever attain the Chief Good, if all those
goods, which though desirable are external to us,
formed part of the Chief Good. ,

is that it is in this way: we maintain these external
goods by those acts of duty which spring from the
particular class of virtue connected with each. F or
