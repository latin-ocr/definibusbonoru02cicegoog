INTRODUCTION

in regard to Stoicism. Recent books of value are
Arnold’s Roman Stoicam, Hicks’s Stoic and Epicurean,
and Bevan’s Stoica and Scepties. Reid’s edition of
Academica is a mine of information about Cicero's
philosophical work. For the sources, a selection for
beginners is Adam's Terta to Illustrate Greek Philo·
sophy after Aristode.

. I must express my gratitudo to my friend Miss
W. M. L. Hutchinson for reading the proofs of my
translation and doing much to improve it. Nor can
Ι forget my debt to the late Dr James Adam, whose
lectures on de Finibns first aroused my interest in
ethical theory.
