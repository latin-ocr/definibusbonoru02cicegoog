defeat. For every stage of this development there

capacity is so constituted by nature that it appears fflssfflss

designed to achieve every kind of virtue; hence ffiffiffi‘

children, without instruction, are actuated by sem-
blances of the virtues, of which they possess in them-
selves the seeds, for those are primary elements of
our nature, which seeds sprout and blossom into
virtue. For we are so constituted from birth as to
contain within us the primary instincts of activity, of
affection, of liberality and of gratitude3 we are also .
gifted with minds that are adapted to knowledge,
prudence and courage, and averse from their oppo-
sites3 hence we see the reason why we observe in
children those sparks of virtue I have mentioned,
from which the philosopher's torch of reason must
be kindled, that he may follow reason as his divine
guide and so arrive at nature's goal. ' For as 1 have
repeatedly said already, in the years of immaturity
and intellectual weakness the powers of our nature
are discerned as through a mist; but as the mind
grows older and stronger it learns to know the
capacity of our nature, while recognizing that this
nature is susceptible of further development and has
by itself only reached an incomplete condition.

nature of things, and come to understand thoroughly {fffissglgatun
its requirements; otherwise we cannot know our· must be studio<
selves. That precept was too high for man's dis·
cernment, and was therefore ascribed to a god. lt
is therefore the Pythian Apollo who bids us⁰‘ know
ourselves’3 but the sole road to seh-knowledge isto
know the powers of body and of mind, and to follow
the path of life that gives us their full realization.
