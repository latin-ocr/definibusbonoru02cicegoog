INTRODUCTION

former the Ethicsof Epicurus are expounded, and
in the latter refuted from the Stoic standpoint. The
scene is laid at Cicero's villa in the neighbourhood
of Cumae, on the lovely coast a little north of
Naples. The spokesman of Epicureanism is L. Man-
lius Torquatus, a reference to whose praetorship
(11‚74) fixes the date of the conversation at 50 uc,

shortly after Cicero’s return from his province of
Cilicia. A minor part is given to the youthful
C. Valerius Triarius.

In the second dialogue the Stoic ethics are ex·
pounded (in Book Ill) by Μ. Cato, and criticized (in
Book IV) from the standpoint of Antiochus by
Cicero. Cicero has run down to his place at Tuscu-
lum, fifteen miles from town, fora brief September
holiday, while the Games are on at Rome; and he
meets Cato at the neighbouring villa of Lucullus,
whose orphan son is Cato’s ward. A law passed by
Pompey in 52 uc. is spoken of (IV, l) as new, so

. the date falls in that year; Cicero went to Cilicia

in 51.

The third dialogue (Book V) goes back to a much ·
earlier period in Cicero’s life. Its date is 79 and its
scene Athens, where Cicero and his friends arc
eagerly attending lectures on philosophy. The posi-
tion of the‘ ‘Old Academy’' of Antiochus is main-
tained by M. Pupius Piso Calpurnianus, and after-
wards criticized by Cicero from the Stoic point of
view ; the last word remains with Piso. The others
present are Cicero’s brother and cousin, and his
friend and correspondent Titus Pomponious Atticus,
a convinced Epicurean, who had retired to Athens
from the civil disorders at Rome, and did not return
for over twenty years·
