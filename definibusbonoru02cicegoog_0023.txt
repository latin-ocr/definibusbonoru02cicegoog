body is dissol'ved by death. ν Death therefore means
extinction. ,

Thus man was relieved from the superstitious that
preyed upon his happiness-fem of the gods and
fearof punishment after death. But a worse tyranny
remained if all that happens is caused by inexorable
fate. Here comes in the doctrine of the Swerve,
which Cicero derides, but which is essential to the
system. Democritus had taught that the heavier
atoms fell faster through the void than the lighter
oneS, and so overtook them. Aristotle corrected the
>err0r; and Epicurus turned the correction to account.
He gave his atoms a uniform vertical velocity‚ but
supposed them to collide by casually making a slight
sideway movement. This was the minimum hypo-
thesis that he could think of to account for the
formation of things ; and it served his purpose by
destroying the conception of a fixed order in Nature.
The capacity to swerve is shared by the atoms that
compose the human soul; hence it accounts for the
action of the will, which Epicurus regards as entirely
undetermined. ln this fortuitous universe man is
free to make his own happiness

In Ethics Epicurus based himself on Aristippus,
the pupil of Socrates and ¹founder of the School of
Cyrene. With Aristippus he held that pleasure is the
only good, the sole constituent of man’s well-being.
Aristippus had drawn the practical inference that
the right thing to do is to enjoy each pleasure of the
moment as it offers. His rule of conduct is summed

was so modified by Epicurus as to become in his hands

an entirely different theory. Its principa] tenets are:
