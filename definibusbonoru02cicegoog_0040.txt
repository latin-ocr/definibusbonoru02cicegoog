in Greek, rs sure to encounter criticism from different
quarters Certai'n persons, aad those not without
some pretension to letters, disapprove of the study
of philosophy altogether. Others do not so greatly

others whom Ι considered competent judges en-
couraged me to embark upon further undertakings3
for Ι did not wish to be thought incapable of sus-
taining the interest that Ι had succeeded in arousing.
