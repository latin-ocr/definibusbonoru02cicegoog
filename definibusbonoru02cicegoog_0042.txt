BOOK 1.· 1 ιι

The second class of critics, who, however much theyafl <1r or
approve of philosophy, nevertheless would ratherthor mughsrd
have it less eagerly prosecuted, are asking for a

restraint that it is not easy to practise. The study

is one thatwhen oncetaken upadmitsof no restriction

or control. In fact, the altitude of the former class,

who attempt to dissuade us from philosophy alto-

gether, seems almost less unreasonable than that of

those who would set limits to what is essentially un-·

limited, and expect us to stop half-way in a study

3 that increases in value the further it proceeds If
Wisdom be attaiuable, let us not only win but enjoy
it; or if attainment be difficult, still there is no end
to the search for truth, other than its discovery. It ·
¹were base to flag in the pursuit, when the object pur-
sued is so supremely lovely. Indeed if we like writing,
who would be so churlish as to debar us from it? Or
if we find ita labour, who is to set limits to another
man's exertions? No doubt it is kind of Chremes
in Terence's play to urge his new neighbour

Neither to dig nor plough nor burdens bearat
for it is not industry in general, but toil of a menial
kind, from which he would deter him; but only a
husybody would take exception to an occupation
which, like mine, is a labour of love.

the objection of those who profess a contempt formr phlfm ‹Lesrgpffietetr
Latin writings as such. What astonishes me first of all Μ
about them 1s this ,—why should they dislike their
native language for serious and important subjects
when they are quite willing to read Latin plays trans-
lated word for word from the Greek? Who has such

. a hatred, one might almost say, for the very name of
Roman, as to despise and reject the Medea of Ennius
