INTRODUCTION

de treasures of Greek thought within the reach of the
⁸¹ Roman public. Both his Academico and de Finibus
were compiled in the following summer; the latter
was probably presented to Brutus, to whom it is
dedicated, on his visit to Cicero In August 45 (ad
Art. XIII, 44). Seven months later Brutus was one
'Jof the assassins of Caesar. In the autumn of 44
{Cicero flung himself again into the arena with his
'attack on Antony, which led to his proscription and

death in December 43.
Excepting the de Oratore, de Republica and de
Legibus, the whole of Cicero’s most important
‘dos writings on philosophy and rhetoric belong to
sition- 46-44 uc. and were achieved within two years.
Such a mass of work so rapidly produced could
hardly be original, and in fact it made no claim to
be so. lt was designed as a sort of encyclo aedia
llos pphilosohy for Roman readers. Cicero’s plan was
to take each chief department of thought in turn,
and present the theories of the leading schools upon
it, appending to each theory the criticisms of its
opponents. Nor had his work that degree of inde-
pendence which consists in assimilating the thought
of others and recasting it in the mould of the writer’s
own mind. He merely chose some recent hand-book
· on each side of tl1e question under consideration,
and reproduced it in Latin, encasing passages of
contiuuous exposition in a frame of dialogue, and
adding illustrations from Roman history and poetry.
He puts thematter frankly In a letter to Atticus
(XII, 52): “You will say, ‘What is your method in
such compositionsi' They are mere transcripta, and
eost comparatively little labour; I only supply the
words, of which I have a eopious flow.’' ln de F initos
