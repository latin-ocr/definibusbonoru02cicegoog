enormous profits it suffers a single loss. Does one
principle hold good in ererything else, but another
in conduct? Will you not judge of the whole by
the largest part? Is there any doubt that virtue
occupies so large a part in human affairs that it
eclipses every other factor? Well then, I shall make
bold to call the other things in accordance with
nature ‘goods,' and not cheat them of their old
name, rather than excogitate some new one; but l
shall place the massive bulk of virtue in the opposite

scale of the balance. Believe me, that scale will mles ἰὴ
weigh down the earth and the seas. Itis a uni· Μ e
versal rule that any whole takes its name from its
most predominant and preponderaut part. We
say that a man is a cheerful fellow3 but if he is
once in rather low spirits, has he therefore lost
his title to cheerfulness for ever? Well, the rule
was not applied to Marcus Crassus, who according
to Lucilius laughed but once in his life; that one

as lucilius has it. Polycrates of &mos was called
‘the fortunate.’ Nota single untoward circum·

thrown his favourite ring overboard at sea.b Did
that single annoyance then make him unfortunate?
and did he become fortunate again when the ,very
same ring was found in a fish’s belly? But Poly-
crates, if he was foolish (which he certainly was,
since he was a tyrant), was never happy; if wisc, he
was not miserable even when crucified by ¹Oroetes,
the satrap of Darius. ‘But' you say, ‘many evils
befell himl’ Who denies it? but those evils were
eclipsed by the magnitude of his virtue.e
