INTRODUCTION

understanding and of will (the Stoics did not separate
the two, since for them the mind is one) is Wisdom
’ οι Virtue, which is the only g00d3 their wrongness is
Folly or V ice, the only evil. Not that we are to ignore
external things: on the contrary, it is in choosing

itis the effort to attain them alone that counts.

This nice adjustment of the claims of Faith and
Works was formulated' m a series of technicalities
A scale of values was laid down, and on it a scheme
of conduct was built up Virtue alone rs ‘'good
and ‘to be sought,’ Vice alone ‘evil' and ‘to be
shunned’3 all else rs ‘indifferent' But of things
indifferenb some, being m accordance with nature,
are ‘promoted' or ‘preferred' (προηγμένα), as
having ‘'worth (ἀξία), and· these are (ιο be
chosen'; others, being contrary to nature, are ‘d-e
romoted' (ἀποπροηγμένα) as having ‘unworth'
ῗάποξίο, negative value), and these are ‘to bc re-
jected'3 while other things again are ‘absolutely
indifferent} and supply no motive for action. To
aim at securing ‘things promotedj or avoiding
their opposites rs an ‘appropriate act' (καθῆκον);
this· rs what the young and uncorrupted do by ιιι-
stinct When the same aim is taken by the rational
adult with full knowledge of nature's plan and
deliberate intent to conform with it, then the
‘appropriate act is ‘Jperfect and isa ‘right
action' or ‘'success (κατόρθωμα).11ιιιοιιιίοιι,ιιοι

¹Cicero inevitably obscures the point ιιι rendering καθῆκον
by offimum To say that fungi οβῖιίο,ι ιο do one'sdutyss
is not recte facere makes the doctrine sound more paradox
cal than it really was.
