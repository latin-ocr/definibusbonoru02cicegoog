BOOK 1. ii-iii

Mnesarchus, Panaetius, and many others, not least
our friend Posidonius. Again, Theophrastus haudles

topics previously treated by Aristotle, yet he gives ’

and Afranius from Menander. Nor yet shall Ι object,
like our Lucilius, to all the world s reading what Ι

also his writings are in a lighter vein: they show
consummate wit, but no great erudition. I, however,
need not be afraid of any reader, if Ι am so bold
as to dedicate my book to you, who rival even
