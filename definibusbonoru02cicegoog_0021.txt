the empire of Macedon, and the barrier between
Greek and barbarian was giving way. The wars of
Alexander's successors rendered all things insecure;
exile, slavery, violent death were possibilities with
which every man must lay his account

Epicureanism and Stoicism, however antagonistic,
have certain common features corresponding to the
needs of the period. Philosophy was systematized,
and fell into three recognized departments, Logic,
Physics and Ethics; and for both schools the third
department stood first in importance. Both schools
offered dogma, not speculation; a way of life for man
as man, not as Greek citizen. Both abandoned
idealism‚ saw no r'eality save matter, and accepted
sense experience as knowledge. Both studied the
world of nature only in order to understand the
position os man. Both looked for a happiness
secure from fortune’ s changes3 and found it in peace
of mind, undisturbed by fear and desire. But here
fthe rival teachers diverged: Epicurus sought peace
in the liberation of man's will from nature’s law,
'Zeno m submission to it31'and m their conceptions
of nature they differed profoundly.

heading of Canonie. The Canon or measuring-rod,
the¹ criterion of truth, is furnished by the sensations
and by the πάθη or feelings of pleasure and pain.
Epicurus's recognition of the latter as qualities of
any state of consciousness and as distinct from the
sensations of sight, hearing, etc, marks a notable

of his lapses from Stoicism into Cyrenaicism.
