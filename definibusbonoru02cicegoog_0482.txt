BOOK V. xvi-xvii

“Now inasmuch as our original instinct of desire rheperrecuor

was for the possession of the parts aforesaid in their ξξιξῗξζξξέῗο,

fullest natural perfectiori, it must be allowed that, the &1de
when we have attained the object of our desire, our

nature takes its stand in this as its final End, and

this constitutes our Chief Good; and that this End

as a whole must be desired intrinsically and in and

several parts of it also have already been proved to
